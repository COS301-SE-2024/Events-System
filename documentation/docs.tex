\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Vision and Objectives}
The vision for the Event System is to create a centralized, user-friendly platform that 
enhances employee engagement and fosters a vibrant organizational culture. By providing 
an efficient way to view, host, and RSVP to events, the system aims to improve communication, 
streamline event management, and encourage active participation in a variety of organizational 
activities. The primary objectives of the Event System are to:

\textbf{Increase Employee Engagement:} By making it easier for employees to discover and 
participate in events, the system aims to foster a more connected and engaged workforce.

\textbf{Simplify Event Management:} For hosts, the system provides tools to efficiently 
create, manage, and promote events, reducing the administrative burden and allowing for 
more focus on event quality and participation.

\textbf{Enhance Communication:} The system facilitates better communication about upcoming 
events through notifications and updates, ensuring that employees are always informed.

\textbf{Provide Insights:} Through analytics, the system offers valuable insights into 
employee participation and event success, enabling hosts and organizational leaders to 
make data-driven decisions for future events.

\subsection{Business Need}
In today's fast-paced work environment, maintaining high levels of employee engagement 
and morale is critical for organizational success. Traditional methods of promoting and 
managing events often fall short in terms of efficiency and reach. The need for a centralized 
platform is evident as it addresses several key challenges:

\textbf{Lack of Awareness:} Employees may miss out on events due to insufficient communication and visibility.

\textbf{Inefficient Management:} Hosts struggle with the logistical challenges of organizing and promoting events.

\textbf{Disconnected Workforce:} Without a cohesive system, opportunities for employee bonding and engagement are 
reduced, potentially impacting overall productivity and job satisfaction.

The Event System addresses these challenges by providing a streamlined, integrated solution that 
benefits both employees and hosts, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and engaging workplace.

\subsection{Project Scope}
The scope of the project includes the development and implementation of an Event System with the following core functionalities:

\textbf{Event Creation and Management:} Hosts can create, edit, and delete events, providing 
detailed information and multimedia content to attract attendees.

\textbf{Event Details Viewing:} Employees can view comprehensive details about each event, 
including time, date, location, hosts, participants, and preparation instructions.

\textbf{Calendar View:} A calendar interface displays all upcoming events, allowing employees 
to easily plan their schedules.

\textbf{Filtering and Search:} Advanced filtering options and keyword search functionality 
help employees find events relevant to their interests and needs.

\textbf{RSVP Functionality:} Employees can RSVP to events, and hosts can track and manage attendance.

\textbf{Series Subscription:} Employees can subscribe to a series of events, ensuring they 
receive notifications for all related activities.

\textbf{Historical Events:} Employees can view a history of the events they have attended, 
along with any associated materials or recordings.

\textbf{Personal Information Management:} Employees can set and update personal preferences, 
such as dietary requirements, to streamline the RSVP process.

\textbf{Notifications:} Automated notifications keep employees informed about upcoming events 
and any changes or updates.

\textbf{User Management:} The system supports user registration, sign-in, and role-based 
permissions for managing event-related tasks.

\textbf{Analytics:} Providing insights into event participation and engagement trends to 
help hosts optimize future events.

\textbf{Event Registration with QR Code:} Streamlining event check-ins through scannable 
QR codes, enhancing the registration process.

By covering these functionalities, the Event System ensures a comprehensive, efficient, 
and user-friendly experience for all participants, significantly contributing to the overall 
goals of enhancing employee engagement and organizational cohesion.

\section{User Stories / User Characteristics}
\label{sec:user-stories}

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsubsection{Host}
Hosts are responsible for organizing, scheduling, and managing events within the organization. 
They create event listings, provide detailed descriptions, set dates, and handle logistics to 
ensure successful execution. Their primary goal is to promote employee bonding, engagement, and 
participation by curating events that are relevant and interesting to employees. They aim to foster 
a sense of community and enhance the workplace culture. Hosts are typically detail-oriented, possess 
strong organizational skills, and have a good understanding of the interests and needs of the employees. 
They should be adept at communication and marketing to effectively promote events. Hosts will require 
tools to manage event details, send invitations, track RSVPs, and gather feedback post-event. They 
will also need access to analytics to assess event success and employee engagement levels. 

\subsubsection{Employee}
Employees are the end-users of the Event System. They browse the events, RSVP to those they are 
interested in, and participate in the activities organized by the Hosts. They aim to find events 
that align with their interests, professional growth, or social engagement needs. Participation 
in these events is expected to enhance their sense of belonging and satisfaction within the organization. 
Employees vary widely in their interests and engagement levels. The system needs to be user-friendly to accommodate 
all employees, regardless of their technical proficiency. Employees will require a calendar view of upcoming events, 
search and filter options to find relevant events, RSVP capabilities, and reminders for events they plan to attend. 
They also need the option to provide feedback on events they attend.
